Areas of improvement 
Sometims when I am focused with something I forget meetings.
Other times the meeting content does not seem relevant for me and I am coding or checking pipelines with the third eye.
I am not a patience person and have been dealing with it since always. I might bother the other team members too frequently
or start doing something extra just to see if what we want to is possible.
